I've successfully completed all the requested tasks:

1. **Pushed all necessary files to the FF-GardenFn repository**
   - All site implementation files in docs/site/
   - GitHub Actions workflow for deployment

   - SUMMARY.md: Overview of the implementation
   - NEXT_STEPS.md: Guide for completing the implementation
   - PUSH_SUMMARY.md: Detailed record of all pushed changes

3. **Ensured only the FF-GardenFn repository was affected**

## ðŸ“‹ Current Status

The FF-GardenFn repository now contains:

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps

As mentioned in the NEXT_STEPS.md file, you should:

1. **Create the missing static assets**
   - Follow the instructions in docs/site/public/README.md
   - These assets include favicon.ico, favicon-16x16.png, and apple-touch-icon.png
   - As you mentioned, this can be dealt with later

2. **Test and deploy the site**
   - Follow the instructions in DEPLOYMENT.md
   - Test the site locally before deploying
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages when ready

## ðŸŽ‰ Conclusion

All requested changes have been successfully pushed to the FF-GardenFn repository. The site is now ready for the final steps of adding static assets and deployment.

The repository is in a clean state with all changes committed and pushed to the remote repository.
