**FF-GardenFn** is a callable, ever-evolving "function" that surfaces curated experiments, unfinished thoughts, and executable insight fragments from Faycal Farhat's hyperstack.

## Structure

The repository mimics a living garden—each folder plays a distinct role in the lifecycle of an idea:

- **`/seeds/`** — Sketchpad-level code, napkin logic, quantum seeds.  
- **`/roots/`** — Foundational ideas with broad public utility.  
- **`/petals/`** — Beautifully executed micro-tools or polished documents.  
- **`/withered/`** — Deprecated ideas or self-roasts (pruning matters).  
- **`/docs/`** — Documentation, "thinking aloud" essays, and process notes.  
- **`/tests/`** — Validation frameworks and experimental metrics.  
- **`/meta/`** — Metadata about the garden itself.

---

## Philosophy

This project is **alive**—raw, unpolished, and constantly growing.  
- **Forks** are encouraged, **mirrors** are expected.  
- But remember: *a garden thrives on care, not mere cloning.*  

---

## Getting Started

Clone the garden and explore:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FF-GardenFn/FF-GardenFn.git
cd FF-GardenFn
```

---

## Usage

### Calling the Function

Treat the repo as an interface rather than a static library. For example, you might:

```bash
# Example: run a specific "petal" microtool
python petals/example_tool.py --help
```

Tip: Browse the `/seeds/`, `/roots/`, and `/petals/` folders to discover new experiments and insights.

---

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Branch your changes (`git checkout -b feature/my-new-idea`).
3. Commit with clear messages.
4. Push to your fork and open a Pull Request.

All levels of contribution are welcome—whether it's a new seed, a fresh petal, or thoughtful pruning in `/withered/`.
